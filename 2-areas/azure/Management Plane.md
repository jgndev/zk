## Overview

The Management Plane focuses on observability, monitoring and auditing of Azure resources. It is considered a subset or separate layer from the [[Control Plane]] designed to enhance maintainability and agility in architectural solutions.

The Management Plane involves tools and services like [[Azure Monitor]], [[Azure Policy]], and [[Azure Security Center]] to track resource performance, compliance and security.

## Characteristics

- Separated from the [[Control Plane]] for better architectural clarity and operational efficiency.
- Primarily concerned with oversight rather than resource creation or data manipulation.
